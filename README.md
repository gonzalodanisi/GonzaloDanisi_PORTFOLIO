# Gonzalo E. Danisi PORTFOLIO
My name is Gonzalo Danisi, I am 19 years old and I am from Argentina. I started programming on Python in March of 2020, at first it was difficult to me, but then I get used to it, especially because I had had previous knwoledge with logial operators in Excel. As I advanced in the field with Udemy´s courses and YouTube videos, I started to love statistics and data analysis, that is the reason why I decided to start this journey and post almost every project I do. Hope you will enjoy it!
